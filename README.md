Election modeling for 2020 election

This was a short project I did for the 2020 election. The motivation was that this election had a mix of in-person and mail-in voting,
and so to interpret the ballots coming in you have to weight the data appropriately. This tool does that using CSVs for input data.

I used Visual Studio and C++ for the GUI, and no other libraries.
